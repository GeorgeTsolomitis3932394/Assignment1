<h1>Introduction to Information Technology</h1>
<h3>Assessment 1: My Profile</h3>
<p>Student Name: George Tsolomitis</p>
<p>Student Number: S3932394</p>
<p>Student Email: S3932394@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Through this assessment, I have introduced myself thoroughly, and discussed a number of different topics, all of which I am deeply interested in. I emphasize my interest in IT and why I chose to come to RMIT, what I expect to learn during my studies, and what my ideal job would be in the future. It goes without saying that I would be interested in any job role that has IT work involved and that has endless opportunities to follow that career path.</p>
<p>I have chosen a number of tests to complete that show my audience, or readers, what I am like as a person. The personality test takes us through a diverse range of questions that result in an answer that is totally dependant on what answers are given to each question. The learning style and creativity quizzes use the same algorithm as the personality test, and they can both give very surprising results.</p>
<p>My project idea is quite unique in the way of contributing to the gaming world, and I feel as though it can be a quite complex, however very rewarding for myself, and the user if successful. My in-depth description of my idea can be seen as doable in many eyes, as there are similar applications out in the world, however, the algorithm and background of my application are quite different.</p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>My name is George Tsolomitis, I am 25 years old, and I am from South Australia. I come from a Greek background as my grandparents and my dad are from Greece who travelled to Australia a number of years ago.</p>
<p>I have previously completed my year 12 studies and was going to continue on to complete a degree in Graphic Design, however after taking a year off, I decided I had a change of heart. I am currently working in a Financial Planning firm and have been studying to become a Financial Planner, then to go on and complete my Accounting degree. My ultimate long-life goal is to study more into IT as I am interested in technology and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I do speak the Greek language and have been to Greece a number of times however Covid and restrictions have stopped me from going again. Going to Greece is a big experience for me as I love seeing where my dad grew up and where my ancestors come from.</p>
<p>In my free time, when I am not working or studying, I am building cars in my shed which is one of my hobbies and has been since I was a young kid. I love to restore objects, whether that is cars, computers, and electrical appliances. I remember as a kid, I had a battery, some wires, a motor from a remote-control car, and come fins from a remote-control helicopter. I put them all together and made a small fan, which is an easy task but I felt so accomplished. I also use my down time for gaming with friends and spending time with my partner.</p>

<h3>What is your interest in IT</h3>
<p>I have always been interested in technology from a young age. My uncle had an IT business a number of years ago and most weekends as a young boy I would spend time learning the basics of computers and other technology. From then, my passion for technology grew as the world transitioned into a more modern era, and my vast knowledge for technology has only improved, and my passion has only grown. To this day, I still turn to my uncle for advice and knowledge on technology.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I chose to enrol in ‘Introduction to Information Technology’ with RMIT as more of a starting point for my future with technology and what’s to come. After some research, I noticed that RMIT are one of the leading universities for technology and I only want the best schooling for my future endeavours.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I expect to learn the crucial ingredients to becoming a successful IT, and what exactly is included in going on the IT journey and how far it can take me. I intend to learn all aspects of technology to have a wide variety of knowledge over different areas of the industry.</p>

<h3>Ideal job?</h3>
<p>My ideal job that lies within the IT industry, would be an ‘IT Engineer,’ which is due to the large range of responsibilities that are set out in the job profile. The job that I am interested in requires 2-3 years of experience, extensive knowledge of operating systems, hardware and software skills, such as troubleshooting, and also online server systems. I plan to develop a wide range of knowledge in reference to technology by completing a university degree, and also commencing a small business doing basic tasks, until I have my degree, and then I will continue on to secure my ideal job, which will then lead me to possibly owning my own full-time business after many years of experience.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
<h5>16 Personalities Test (Advocate)</h5>
<p>The personality test resulted in an Advocate personality, and I feel as though this best describes me as a person. I use my personality to help others and to take a stand for what I think is the right course of action, however I do see myself challenging others as some scenarios need to be challenged in order for a lesson to be learnt. In saying that, I am not one to take extreme measures to challenge others, especially if I am working within a team, I am more of a person to challenge my peers to find a solution to solve their problem so that they understand what to do next time. When forming a team, I feel as though different personalities are better due to the different perspectives that may arise if there are issues within the team. I welcome criticism as I feel as though that is the only way we learn as a society.</p>

<h5>Learning Style Test (Visual/Tactile)</h5>
<p>The learning style test has truly been on point with the result, as I do tend to learn faster and easier to watch and learn, then by proceeding to be hands on with the task at hand. The test results show the truth on my learning styles, as I am a visual learner, but I am also a tactile learning which helps me to absorb information at a much quicker pace than most. I think these results will be able to help my behaviour in a team environment as I will be able to learn how my team works and captivate their knowledge while expressing mine. When forming a team, I feel as though this will help to see what my team is made up of, along with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<h5>Creativity Quiz (Work in Progress)</h5>
<p>In some cases, I feel as though this result is correct but also incorrect at the same time. The meaning behind this is that depending on the task at hand, will depend on the level of creativity provided in each scenario or task. I feel as though my creativeness will bring positive work to the team and provide an inventive influence on my team to help them. Everyone has their own degree of creativeness in diverse situations, which I feel that each person of the team will contribute in their own creative way.</p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<h5>Overview</h5>
<p>Developing a smartphone application has been a potential project that has been in the back of my mind for many years and there have always been a diverse range of application designs that have triggered my interest for a project of this magnitude. I have always wanted to design a smartphone application that includes high quality technology, and high-quality gaming, however my idea is not to build a game, but to build an application for gamers. The gaming industry is only growing each and every day, and my project idea can help talented and devoted gamers easily express their talents.</p>

<h5>Motivation</h5>
<p>It is without saying that since Covid-19, many people are finding themselves at home with nothing to do more often due to restrictions and lockdowns in Australia. This has increased the number of gamers, streamers, and content creators that the industry has seen for many years. In 2019, consumers of Australia spent $3.175 billion towards the gaming industry, and since then, it has only grown significantly (Mitchell Van Homrigh 2021), which means that there is a much greater chance that my smartphone application will hit the market, making it easier for all the new gamers to become known within the industry.</p>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>My smartphone application idea has been constructing itself within my brain for the past few years. Let’s just say that I have been brainstorming for a while, but never took the time to sit down and make notes. The world already has applications for streamers that can be accessed on a diverse range of platforms and devices, and I do not want to restrict my application to smartphones because there is an abundance of gamers that use different devices to play, watch and stream their content. My application idea has been brainstormed to be able to function on all platforms and devices, the main one being smartphones, along with Personal Computers, Smart TV’s, gaming consoles, iPad’s, and many more modern devices.</p>
<p>This application will be designed to help the new streamers and content creators to grow and have a proper audience, and to continue to hit goals within their gaming career. There will be a ranking system in place to put each gamer into a category, and the viewers will also have their own ranking system. In simple terms, a rank 10 viewer will be restricted to rank 10 or lower streamers, which means if the viewer wants to continue to view their favourite streamer, they will have to continue to gain ranks. This ranking system will help the small time streamers to increase their views and create a bigger audience.</p>
<p>The ranking system is a very simple yet precise structure, where streamers will gain ranks by the amount of hours that they stream, the amount of viewers, comments, subscriptions, and gifts that they receive. I feel as though this system will encourage gamers to stream more often as it gives them motivation to expand their audience. The amount of streaming hours that are accumulated at the end of each month will also boost their rank. The viewers will gain ranks by the amount of watch hours, when they subscribe and gift to a streamer, and just like the streamers, they too will get a boost on ranks at the end of each month depending on the amount of watch hours they have accumulated. A viewer has to be either the same rank or higher as their favourite streamer, to be able to view their content.</p>
<p>Each streamer will have a private feed, which will be content for subscribers only, and then a public feed which will be advertisement of content to capture a bigger audience. The application will include an offline conversation tab, where subscribers can chat with the streamer offline. This can help create a bond between active subscribers and streamers to keep them subscribed and give them opportunities to be involved with their favourite streamers.</p>
<p>This application will also help those up and coming streamers to become sponsored by large companies, and become the face of new products that are being developed all across the world.</p>
<p>My idea for this application is to be strictly gaming, and anything other than gaming will result in a strike, and after 3 strikes, a demotion of ranking will be applied to a streamers account causing them to lose viewers and credibility.</p>
<p>The application is currently still in the brainstorming process, so there is a possibility that there will be added features later down the track.</p>

<h5>Tools and Technology</h5>
<p>The application that I intend to build is a complex and sophisticated design and may take many years to become published, however a good running and up to date computer with some extra much needed knowledge help me to complete my ideal project if I was to go ahead with it. I think my current knowledge on coding will restrict my ability to even commence such a project, but there are many other applications that can help to code or provide the tools and technology to begin the process (Guest Contributor 2017). However, this is where I feel that my ideal IT job would partially come in handy with the more simplistic restrictions that I will encounter.</p>

<h5>Skills Required</h5>
<p>The wide range of skills required would be challenging, mostly because I have never written code or built an application, especially to this extent. Product management, design, writing, performance testing, precise coding, data, and cross-platform skills are some of the most important skills to have when building an application of this magnitude (“7 Must have skills to develop killer apps” 2017). Learning these skills takes years to acquire however, it is achievable, with reading coding books, searching the internet, watching videos, and taking classes, which is the same process for software and hardware knowledge.</p>

<h5>Outcome</h5>
<p>I feel as though the outcome of this application would be a success, for the pure fact that there are so many small-time streamers that cannot make their debut and get trapped. Given the sophisticated ranking system, streamers will be able to increase their viewership and rank, which will motivate them to keep climbing and finding those viewers, and reaching their goals. This development will be able to help new streamers or content creators make a name for themselves at the beginning of their streaming career.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>To conclude, I feel as though I have shown a great deal of information regarding myself, my personality and skills. The extent that I am willing to go to for my project idea is a great deal, and I hope to one day accomplish my project that I have been brainstorming for quite a while. Given my personal traits, I feel like I would be the perfect candidate to start off in a position that I have chosen for my ideal job, as I have great communication skills, I am not afraid to try new things, and I push people to be the best that they can be.</p>
